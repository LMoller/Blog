      <description>I am very excited to start recording some of my work, thought processes, passion and excitement for data science and social policy. I plan to share R and Python code from projects I’m working on, books I’m reading, classes I’m taking… partly to be selfish and relearn the information by “teaching” it, but also hoping to reach people interested in (and new to) the intersection of data science and the policy/non-profit world.</description>

      <description>This started more as a place to keep all of the book and article suggestions that I&#39;ve receieved, or interesting titles I&#39;ve come across - meaning I haven&#39;t read many of these books/articles/papers, but would love to. I am SURE there are plenty I am leaving off of here - please add favorites to the comments!
I will also continue to find all of the emails I sent myself and notes in margins of randoms notebooks to find more titles&amp;hellip;</description>
