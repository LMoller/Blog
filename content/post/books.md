This started more as a place to keep all of the book suggestions that I've receieved, or interesting books I've come across - meaning I haven't read many of these books, but would love to. I am SURE there are plenty I am leaving off of here - please add favorites to the comments!

I will also continue to find all of the emails I sent myself and notes in margins of randoms notebooks to find more titles...
