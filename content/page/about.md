My love for data and policy started in undergrad as I was studying math and biology. As my research became more focused, I saw how people used/misused/ignored data and research when making policy decisions. I chose to go to law school wanting to use my technical background to help support research-based policy. After working several years as an attorney focused on Health Law and Policy, I turned my attention to programming. I worked as a Data Engineer* for a large corporation for five and a half years and loved being in the Business Intelligence group, learning from talented people. Now I've come full-circle and am bringing my skills together, helping non-profits, community groups, and anyone who is interested make sense of the data.

*Not actually a Data Engineer, but that seems like the closest "generic"" title. :) I was an Essbase Analyst. Essbase is a financial reporting tool, so my job was to pull data from many sources around the company and aggregate the information in our tool.
