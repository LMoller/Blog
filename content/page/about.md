My love for data and policy started in undergrad as I was studying math and biology. As my research became more focused, I saw how people used/misused/ignored data and research when making policy decisions. I chose to go to law school wanting to use my technical background to help support research-based policy. After working several years as an attorney focused on Health Law and Policy, I turned my attention to programming. I worked as (something close to) a Data Engineer for a large corporation for five and a half years and loved being in the Business Intelligence group, learning from talented people. I now work for my county as a data analyst. I love working close to my community.

I started this blog to record some of my work, thought processes, passion and excitement for data science and social policy. I plan to share R code from projects I'm working on, books I'm reading, classes I'm taking... partly to be selfish and relearn the information by "teaching" it, but also hoping to reach people interested in (and new to) the intersection of data science and the policy/non-profit world. 

My posts may not always be explicitly policy related, but I do always have the non-profit/policy perspective in the back of my mind. Please let me know if there are topics you are interested in seeing. Also, I would LOVE feedback on posts from those who have worked similar issues! There are always 100 ways to do things, so I want to hear your pros/cons/thoughts.
